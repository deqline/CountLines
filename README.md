# TotalCodeLines-ST4
![](https://ibb.co/w0yb1pr)

A sublime text plugin to count the total number of lines in code files in your project. This plugin simply checks for the number of lines in every file in the current directory with specific extensions (for now "('.c', '.cpp', '.h', '.hpp','.py','.java','.asm')").

To access the number of lines open the command palette and find "CountLines".

# TODO
- Add settings file to provide extensions list
- Add more stats on dialog (i.e: readability score, entropy, code repetition, ...)
